# Sierpinski-Triangle
Creates a Sierpinski triangle using a sequence of semi-random dots using python turtles 


While scrolling through tiktok one day I found this video https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRpWFkfD/. This video showed me the concept of making the Sierpinski triangle using "random" dots. However, in the video it mentions you would need about 10,000 dots to properly create the picture and that was way to much to do by hand. So, I quickly made a program to draw it for me.
